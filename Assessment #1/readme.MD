Managing Peak Hour Patient Flow at Urban Multi-Specialty Clinic

Context: Jayanagar Specialty Clinic in Bangalore sees 300+ patients daily with peak congestion between 5-8pm when working professionals arrive. The 15 specialists have varying consultation patterns.

Problem Outline:

* Situation: The clinic reports 40-minute average wait times during evening hours, with some patients waiting up to 90 minutes
* Data Available:
  * 3 months of appointment records showing scheduled vs. actual times
  * Doctor-wise average consultation durations (ranging from 8-22 minutes)
  * Peak vs. non-peak hour patient distribution (75% of patients prefer evening slots)

Evaluation Task:

* Design an AI approach that could reduce evening wait times by at least 30%
* Suggest 3 specific prediction features that would be most valuable
* Explain how the system should handle the common scenario of patients arriving 20-30 minutes before their appointment expecting to be seen earlier

Expected Solution Elements:

* Predictive load balancing across available doctors
* Time-slot optimization based on consultation patterns
* Patient communication strategy for realistic wait time
